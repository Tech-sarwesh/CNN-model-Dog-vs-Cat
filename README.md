## 📖 Project Description  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of **cats and dogs** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

The workflow includes:  
✔️ Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, train/validation split)  
✔️ Building & training a CNN model from scratch  
✔️ Evaluating model accuracy & loss on unseen test data  
✔️ Visualizing confusion matrix for performance analysis  
✔️ Predicting on custom images with visualization
